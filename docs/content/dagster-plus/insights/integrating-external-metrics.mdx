# Integrating external metrics into Dagster+ Insights (Experimental)

<Note>
  This feature is considered <strong>experimental</strong>.
</Note>

External metrics, such as Snowflake credits, can be integrated into the Dagster Insights UI. The [`dagster-plus`](https://pypi.org/project/dagster-plus/) package contains utilities for capturing and submitting external metrics about data operations to Dagster+ via an API.

---

## Limitations

Before you start, note that:

- This is a Dagster+ Pro feature
- Up to two million individual data points may be added to Insights, per month
- External metrics data will only be retained for 90 days

---

## Supported integrations

Currently, Insights supports integrating Snowflake metrics for:

- **Usage generated by queries made to Snowflake resources.** Refer to the [Integrating direct Snowflake usage with Dagster+ Insights guide](/dagster-plus/insights/integrating-snowflake) for more info.
- **Snowflake usage generated by dbt.** Refer to the [dbt & Snowflake & Dagster+ Insights guide](/dagster-plus/insights/integrating-snowflake-and-dbt) for more info.
